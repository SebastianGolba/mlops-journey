# Week 1 Day 1 — Setup + Basics
Date: 2025-08-27

What I did
- Installed Ubuntu (WSL2/VM/EC2).
- Configured Git (name/email, default branch, editor).
- Created an SSH key and added it to GitHub.
- Verified SSH connection.

Commands I practiced
pwd (where am I), ls / ls -l (list), cd (change dir), mkdir (make dir),
touch (new file), echo (write), cat (show), mv (move/rename), rm (remove), tree (dir tree)

Gotchas
- Password input showed nothing on Ubuntu setup → normal; typed and pressed Enter twice.
- First SSH to GitHub asked to trust a fingerprint → normal; typed "yes" and it worked.
- wsl --install error (HCS_E_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE) → reboot fixed it; confirmed with wsl --status.
